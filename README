# v4l2-request-test

This standalone tool was designed to help with development and testing of the
Cedrus driver, that supports the Video Engine found on most Allwinner SoCs. It
implements the Linux v4l2 Request API, so it can help to test any driver being
developed using that API.

It currently supports decoding MPEG2 and H264 frames from their slice data
(stored as files) and associated metadata, as well as displaying the decoded
frames through a dedicated DRM plane.

The behavior of the tool can be configured through command line arguments, that
are precised by its usage help.
