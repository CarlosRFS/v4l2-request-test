# cedrus-frame-test

This standalone tool is designed to help with development and testing of the
Sunxi-Cedrus VPU driver, that supports the Video Engine found on most Allwinner
SoCs.

It currently supports decoding MPEG2 frames from their slice data (stored as
files) and associated metadata, as well as displaying the decoded frames through
a dedicated DRM plane, using the sun4i-drm display driver.

The behavior of the tool can be configured through command line arguments, that
are precised by its usage help.
